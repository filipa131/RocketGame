The following video shows the layout of the game. The game ends after time runs out or after losing 3 lives. Lives are reduced by one by colliding with a moving wall (then the spacecraft returns to the beginning) or colliding with a comet (the spacecraft does not return to the beginning, only 1 life is lost). Each crossing of the wall brings 1 point, and collision with diamonds even 5 points. At the end of the game it is possible to repeat the game by pressing the R key.
